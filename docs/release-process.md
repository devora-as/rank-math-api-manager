## 🛠️ Manual Release Process

### **When to Use Manual Process**

- GitHub Actions not working
- Custom release requirements
- Emergency releases

### **Manual Steps**

1. **Prepare Files Locally**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to project root
   cd /path/to/plugin/parent/directory

   # Create clean copy
   mkdir temp-release
   cp -r "Rank Math API Manager-plugin" temp-release/rank-math-api-manager

   # Remove development files
   cd temp-release/rank-math-api-manager
   rm -rf .git* .github/ tests/ .cursor/ node_modules/
   rm -f .DS_Store TODO*.md .env* .gitignore

   # Verify structure
   ls -la
   ```

2. **Create ZIP File**

   ```bash
   # Return to temp directory
   cd ../

   # Create WordPress-compatible ZIP
   zip -r rank-math-api-manager.zip rank-math-api-manager/

   # Verify ZIP contents
   unzip -l rank-math-api-manager.zip
   ```

3. **Upload to GitHub Release**
   - Create release on GitHub (as in automated process)
   - Manually upload the `rank-math-api-manager.zip` file

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **GitHub Action Fails**

   - Check repository permissions
   - Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has correct permissions
   - Check action logs for specific errors

2. **ZIP Structure Incorrect**

   - Verify folder name is `rank-math-api-manager`
   - Check for proper file exclusions
   - Ensure main plugin file is in root of plugin folder

3. **Auto-Update Not Working**
   - Verify ZIP is named exactly `rank-math-api-manager.zip`
   - Check that release is published (not draft)
   - Ensure version number in plugin file matches tag

### **Emergency Release Process**

If automation fails and urgent release needed:

1. **Create ZIP manually** (follow manual process above)
2. **Upload directly to GitHub release**
3. **Test immediately** on WordPress site
4. **Document issue** for future improvement

- ✅ File integrity maintained through ZIP structure
- ✅ Version validation prevents downgrade attacks
